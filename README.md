# Introduction

**This is a work in progress.  Please be patient while I prepare this workshop.  Launch date: March 19, 2019**

This tutorial uses QGIS 3 to teach the basics of desktop mapping software for beginners with no previous mapping experience.

## Workshop Preparation
You should download and install [QGIS](https://qgis.org) version 3.4 to your computer.

## Workshop Aims
This introductory-level workshop will focus upon the fundamental concepts and skills needed to explore and analyze begin using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) software for the exploration and analysis of spatial data using the QGIS platform. 

No prior experience with QGIS or other GIS software is needed, though attendees should be comfortable learning new computer applications, working with the basics of spreadsheets, and managing/organizing computer files. 

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand the basic distinctions between open-source QGIS and proprietary GIS products like ArcGIS Desktop and ArcGIS Pro
- Download spatial data from the San Fransicoâ€™s [open data portal (DataSF)](https://datasf.org/opendata/) and use it in QGIS to conduct data analysis and to produce maps. 
- Define GIS and geospatial concepts and terminology.
- Know the difference between vector and raster data types
- Properly connect and add data to a QGIS project
- Know where to find the attributes of your data in QGIS
- Perform basic selections and queries in QGIS
- Symbolize data by attributes
- Assemble a basic map for export

# What is GIS?

# Why QGIS?

[QGIS](https://www.qgis.org) is an open source, community-driven desktop GIS software that allows users to visualize and analyze spatial data in a variety of ways.  There are many reasons to use QGIS, but here are a few: 

- It's a robust, powerful desktop GIS
- Runs on all major platorms: Mac, Linux, & Windows
- Free of charge, all access (no paid add-ons or extensions)
- Frequent updates & bug fixes
- Responsive, enthusiastic community
- Integration with other geospatial tools & programming languages like R, Python, & PostGIS
- Access to analysis tools from other established software like GRASS and SAGA
- Native access to open data formats like geoJSON & GeoPackage
- Comes in a [more than 40 languages](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/getinvolved/translate.html), making it easier to work with a larger variety of colaborators
- Growing use by local, state, federal, and international governments

# Attributes tables

# Select by attributes

# Symbolizing layers by attributes

1. Single symbols
1. Changing symbols based on attributes

# Making a map with the print composer

1. Add map
1. Adjust scale
1. Add extras - legend, scale bar, etc. + item properties
1. Export
